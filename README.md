I developed this program to manage and calculate account balances based on user purchases and credits for the month. It prompts the user to enter their account number, beginning balance, and the number of items purchased. The program then asks for the charge of each item and sums them up as total charges. Afterward, it requests the total credits applied to the account and the allowed credit limit. The program calculates the new balance and checks if it exceeds the allowed credit limit. If it does, it informs the user of the exceeded amount. This code was tested in the 1st semester lab mid exam 1 of the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES.
